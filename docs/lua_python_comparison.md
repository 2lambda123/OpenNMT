This page lists all the differences between commandline options of `OpenNMT` (lua version) and `OpenNMT-py` (python version). Identical options are not described.

# `tokenize.lua`, `learn_bpe.lua`

There is no python version yet of tokenization/bpe scripts.

# `preprocess.(lua|py)`

OpenNMT-lua reference option list is documented [here](http://opennmt.net/OpenNMT/options/preprocess/)
